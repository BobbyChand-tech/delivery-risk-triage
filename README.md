# AI-Driven Delivery Risk Triage & Operational Prioritisation

## Overview
This project demonstrates how AI can be used to support operational control by
automatically identifying delivery items that genuinely require human intervention.

Rather than producing reports or summaries, the solution prioritises attention,
suppresses noise, and guides leadership action in complex delivery environments.

## Key Features
- Rule-based urgency scoring for delivery risk
- Automated intervention prioritisation
- AI-assisted decision guidance for operational action
- Designed for regulated and enterprise delivery contexts

## Why It Matters
Delivery failure is often caused by misdirected attention, not lack of data.
This approach enables earlier, more focused intervention and reduces reactive management.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Simulated delivery and programme data

## Outputs
- Prioritised operational intervention queue
